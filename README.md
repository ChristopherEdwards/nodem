## Summary and Info ##

Nodem is an Open Source Addon module for Node.js that integrates Node.js
with the [GT.M][] database, providing access to GT.M's database from
Javascript, via GT.M's C Call-in Interface. From Node.js you can perform
the basic primitive Global Database handling operations and also invoke
GT.M/Mumps functions. Although designed exclusively for use with GT.M,
Nodem aims to be API-compatible with the in-process Node.js interface
for [Globals][] and [Cache][], at least for the APIs that have been
implemented in Nodem. As such, please refer to the Globals Node.js [API
documentation][Documentation] for further details on how to use those
APIs.

## Installation ##

There are a few things to be aware of in order to use the Nodem library.
These instructions will assume that the nodem repository has been installed
in your home directory. The paths will likely be different if you have
installed this with npm (Node Package Manager). You will need to change
directories to ~/nodem/lib/ and copy the correct version of mumps.node for
your system architecture (mumps.node_i386 for 32-bit or mumps.node_x8664 for
64-bit) to mumps.node in the ~/nodem/lib/ directory. E.g.

    $ cd ~/nodem/lib
    $ cp mumps.node_x8664 mumps.node
    $ cd -

You will also have to move a copy of libgtmshr.so (GT.M shared runtime
library) into a directory that will be searched by the linker when
mumps.node links to it, if it isn't already located in one. It is bundled
with GT.M where ever you installed it. One good possibility is
/usr/local/lib/ and you could create a symbolic link to it if you chose. You
may have to add that directory to /etc/ld.so.conf or create an
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf file and add it there, and then run ldconfig as
root. E.g.

    $ sudo -i
    $ cd /usr/local/lib
    $ ln -s /opt/lsb-gtm/6.0-001_x8664/libgtmshr.so
    $ exit

In addition you will need to set a few environment variables in order for
GT.M to find the call-in table and the MUMPS routine that it maps to. The
Nodem package supplies a sample environment file, called environ. It is
located in ~/nodem/resources/ and can simply be sourced into your working
environment, either directly, from your own environment scripts or profile
script. E.g.

    $ cd ~/nodem/resources
    $ source environ
or
    $ echo "source ~/nodem/resources/environ" >> ~/.profile

If you did not install Nodem in your home directory, you will need to fix the
paths in the environ file. If you don't source the environ file, than you will
need to put a copy of node.m into a directory that is specified in your
$gtmroutines routine path, so that the GT.M shared library can find it. It is
located in ~/nodem/resources/ directory.

You can clone the repository with this command..

    $ git clone git://github.com/dlwicksell/nodem.git

You can also install it via npm with this command..

    $ npm install nodem

I hope you enjoy the Nodem package. If you have any questions, feature
requests, or bugs to report, please contact David Wicksell <dlw@linux.com>
